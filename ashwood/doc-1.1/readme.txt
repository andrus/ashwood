ASHWOOD - Graph, CS, and Util Java Library

The project ASHWOOD has a goal to create an open source Java implementation
of graphs, graph related algorithms, and other useful concepts and algorithms
of CS, Applied Mathematics, and their applications. Particular attention is
paid to implementation of graphs and algorithms in the spirit of Java 2 standard
collections. The project was originally inspired by the task of the correct
resolving of referential dependencies in database schemas and the resulting
code was used in the object-relational data layer "Cayenne" to improve the
existing commit algorithm. The ASHWOOD library code uses standard Java packages,
Apache-Jakarta packages, and other open source or freeware Java libraries only.
