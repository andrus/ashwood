Ashwood2 is unmaintained and exists for archival purposes ([Apache Cayenne](http://cayenne.apache.org) 3.0 depends on it).

In Cayenne 3.1 and newer versions a subset of Ashwood functionality is incorporated in Cayenne core

The original Ashwood lib can be found [on sourceforge](http://sourceforge.net/projects/ashwood/).

Ashwood2 is a fork of the original Ashwood Graph library developed by Andriy Shapochka. 
A fork is established primarily to tweak the original Ashwood for Cayenne purposes. 
The core graph library is unlikely to be changed.

Ashwood2 is distributed under the Apache 2 license.


Changes: since Ashwood 1.1:

1. Upgraded to Java 5
2. Dropped commons-lang dependency
3. Switched build to Maven2
